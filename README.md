### React Project Meme

This is my first React Project. It is a meme-generator. It generates a meme and user can add a text to it. Whole project is made using React. Images are retrieved using the api

I used these technologies:

- HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- React.JS

I learned to use: 

- Hooks (State Hook and Effect Hook) 
- Forms, 
- Conditional rendering, 
- Creating custom components
